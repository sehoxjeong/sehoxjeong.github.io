I am a Master's in Economics student at Sogang University in South Korea.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on quantitatively analyzing the interaction between financial markets and the real economy. My current work focuses on how financial frictions shape firm dynamics-particularly entry and exit from financial markets-and the implications for investment and employment.

I am also interested in the role of financial intermediaries and institutional investors in corporate financing, with a focus on how their demand for financial assets influences firmsâ€™ access to capital. Drawing on recent developments in demand-based and intermediary asset pricing, I aim to study how the behavior of investors affect asset prices and, in turn, real economic outcomes. I am also exploring the use of machine learning techniques to uncover latent firm characteristics and improve empirical strategy in this context.
